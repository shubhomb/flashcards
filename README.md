# Flashcards

The code in this repository is mostly ChatGPT-generated. This is an  experiment in generative coding.
The goal is to create a small web application allowing the user
to select images and generate a flashcard deck from them. Then,
the user can review the deck and use an LLM to generate mnemonics for the topic 
they searched for.
